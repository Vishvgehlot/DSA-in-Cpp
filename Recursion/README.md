# Recursion & Math Algorithms – C++ Implementations

This repository contains C++ implementations of various recursion techniques and mathematical algorithms.

---

## Recursion Types

- **HeadRecursion.cpp** – Demonstrates head recursion where processing happens after the recursive call.
- **IndirectRecursion.cpp** – Shows indirect recursion involving multiple functions calling each other.
- **LinearRecursion.cpp** – Simple example of linear recursion with a single recursive path.
- **NestedRecursion.cpp** – Implements nested recursion where a recursive call is made inside another recursive call.
- **TailRecursion.cpp** – Tail recursion example where the recursive call is the final operation.
- **TreeRecursion.cpp** – Demonstrates tree recursion where each call generates multiple recursive calls.


Refer to the [Types of Recursion](#Types-of-Recursion) for more depth.
